# StructureFromSound
Code for the Structure from Sound project (SFS)
The aim of the project is to develop tools for estimating microphone positions
and sound source movements using a set of audio files as input only.

This is a challenging parameter estimation problem. 
For the project we also develop tools that can be of use for other TDOA type
problems.

## Code

Run main.m

## Data

Example data for the system can be downloaded from the
StructureFromSoundDatabase (sfsdb)

images of the microphone setup and a few film recordings of the
experiment.
