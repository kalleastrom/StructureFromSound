<H2> Structure from Sound Database (sfsdb)</H2>

<body>

<p>
Here is a database of multi-channel recordings to be used for 'structure from sound' experiments. 
Each experiment consists of a number of audio files, typically 8, one for each microphone. 
In each experiment the microphones are stationary, but in unknown position. 


<ol>
<li>  Download the matlab code from <a href="https://github.com/kalleastrom/StructureFromSound"> https://github.com/kalleastrom/StructureFromSound </a>
<li>  The folder structure should be:
<ul>
<li>  StructureFromSound
<ul>
<li>  matlab 
<ul>
<li>  main.m 
<li>  other matlab code and folders 
</ul>
<li>  data 
<ul>
<li>  savefiles (this folder is used to save intermediate results)
<li>  sfsgt  (this folder contains ground truth for experiments)
<li>  sfsdb (this folder should contain the experiments you want to try. However, this folder is empty when you download it from github)
<ul>
<li>  bassh1 (one experiment folder containing 8 sound files)
<ul>
<li>  bassh1-1.aiff
<li>  bassh1-2.aiff
<li>  ...
<li>  bassh1-8.aiff
</ul>
<li>  bassh2 (another experiment folder containing 8 sound files)
<li>  bassh3 
<li>  ...
</ul>
</ul>
<li>  tex 
<ul>
<li>  StructureFromSound.tex (tex file explaining some of the math and algorithms)
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>  Download the raw sound files from this site <a href="http://vision.maths.lth.se/sfsdb/"> http://vision.maths.lth.se/sfsdb/ </a>
and put the each experiment folder in the folder sfsdb so that you get the right file structure.
<li>  Run main.m 
</ol>
